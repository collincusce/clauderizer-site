## How This Works

This is the coordination point for sessions executing this gameplan. A fresh
session gets current state automatically from the Clauderizer SessionStart hook,
then calls `cz_next_phase_context` for the active phase. No manual reading order.

## Pre-Flight Verification

Run `cz_preflight` before any code. If any enabled check fails: STOP, report.

**Current baseline test count**: 0

## Ending Protocol

1. `cz_transition_phase` the finished phase to complete.
2. `cz_add_output` each concrete produced value; `cz_add_phase_summary` the recap;
   `cz_add_correction` / `cz_add_lesson` as earned.
3. `cz_transition_status` on touched entities (fires cascade); `cz_resolve_cascade`
   the verdicts.
4. `cz_write_handoff` for the next phase.
5. Run exit verification; report the test count.
